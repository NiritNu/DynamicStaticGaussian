## Notes on license:
The code in this repository (except in external.py) is licensed under the MIT licence.

However, for this code to run it uses the cuda rasterizer code from [here](https://github.com/JonathonLuiten/diff-gaussian-rasterization-w-depth),
as well as various code in [external.py](./external.py) which has been taken or adapted from [here](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting).
These are required for this project, and for these a much more restrictive license from Inria applies which can be found [here](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
This requires express permission (licensing agreements) from Inria for use in any commercial application, but is otherwise freely freely distributed for research and experimentation.

MIT License for the code in this repository where it applies (see above) is below:
